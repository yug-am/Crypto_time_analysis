# Cryptography operations time plotting
##  Operations:
- RSA 
- Hashing
- [Diffie Hellman Key Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)

##  RSA Operations
Plotting the Performance graphs of following operations of [RSA cryptosystem ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) using 
[Cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Operations :
- Encryption
- Decryption
- Key size

This is aimed at the recreation of  the graph in [Cryptography Book](#cryptography-book) Chapter 6: Public Key Cryptography and RSA, Page 79, Figure 6.4.

## Hash operations
Plotting the time(in microseconds) of Hash calculation for no. of iterations of for given input sizes using [RSA cryptosystem ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) using 
[Cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

### Hash Functions:
- [SHA224](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)
- [SHA256](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256)
- [SHA384](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3)
- [SHA512](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-512)

Diffie Hellman Key Exchange

## Features 
- Ability to set starting key size, key size range, no of iterations per key size, time unit and y-axis ticks(labels).
- Clubbing of points, multiple iteration and data average for error free data and smooth plot.
- Saves and read data from respective data files in data_dump directory.

## Cryptography Book :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
Cryptography, Network Security, and Cyber Laws [Book](https://www.cengage.co.in/book-list/print/cryptography-network-security-and-cyber-laws-sl) authored by  Bernard L. Menezes | Ravinder Kumar.
ISBN: 9789386858948
Edition: 1st
Year : 2018


## Constraints âš 
-   RSA: [Cryptography library](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) used has limitation of minimum key size of 800 to avoid errors of  Data too long for key size
even for empty string.
-   SHA operations: due to quick execution, SHA operations are measured in bunch of operations.    
-   Diffie Hellman Key Exchange: [Cryptography library](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) used has limitation of minimum key size of 512 bytes fixed.
