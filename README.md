## RSA operations time plotting
Plotting the time(in milliseconds) of following operations of [RSA cryptosystem ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) using 
[Cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Operations :
- Encryption
- Decryption
- Key size

This is aimed at the recreation of  the graph in [Cryptography Book](#cryptography-book) Chapter 6: Public Key Cryptography and RSA, Page 79, Figure 6.4.


## Features 
- Saves and read data from respective data files in data_dump directory.
- Ability to set starting key size, key size range, no of iterations per key size, time unit and y-axis ticks(labels).


## Output

RSA time with key            |  RSA time without key
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
